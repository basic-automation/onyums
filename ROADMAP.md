# Onyums Roadmap: a frontier onion-service framework

Onyums today is a thin axum wrapper with a single public entry point — `serve(app, nickname)` —
that hardcodes essentially every Tor decision: default `TorClientConfig`, a self-signed cert, an
automatic HTTP→HTTPS upgrade, ports 80/443 only, a process-global `ONION_NAME` singleton, and a
fresh `TorClient` per call.

The direction this roadmap commits to: onyums is a **frontier framework** — batteries-included and
secure by default. The hard, Tor-specific machinery (stable identity, abuse resistance, enforced
TLS) is present and on the moment you depend on the crate. You do not assemble safety or capability
from feature flags; you *tune it down* when you have a reason to. We raise the ceiling with advanced
Tor features while making the floor itself fully featured.

## Guiding principles

1. **`serve()` stays a one-liner — and the one-liner is the full secure stack.** The 30-second path
   never regresses, and it already gives you persistent identity, enforced TLS, and abuse defenses.
   Every advanced capability lands behind a builder that *desugars to the same internals*.
2. **Versatility is override, not assembly.** Anything onyums wraps (the `TorClient`,
   `TorClientConfig`, `OnionServiceConfig`, the raw `RunningOnionService`) stays reachable, so power
   users can relax or replace any default — but they start from a complete, secure configuration,
   not an empty one. We already do this philosophically by re-exporting `axum`.
3. **Tor-native assumptions, not HTTP-native ones — with one deliberate exception.** No
   `SocketAddr` leakage, no assuming HTTP is the only protocol. The exception is **TLS: onyums
   treats encrypted, certificate-authenticated transport as the default and can enforce it**
   (see Phase 3). Tor already encrypts the channel, but TLS is still standard here — not optional
   cruft to be stripped away.
4. **Frontier and fully featured out of the gate.** onyums is a batteries-included framework, not
   a minimal kernel you assemble yourself. The advanced, Tor-specific machinery — client auth,
   proof-of-work DoS defense, vanity addresses, restricted discovery, persistent identity — ships
   enabled and ready, not hidden behind opt-in feature flags or a slimming exercise. Depending on
   the crate should mean the hard parts are already there. We accept a heavier dependency tree and
   the cost of tracking arti's frontier as the price of that.
5. **Secure and complete by default; you opt *down*, never *up*.** The defaults are the safe,
   maximal choice — stable address, enforced TLS, DoS defenses live. Relaxing them (ephemeral keys,
   non-strict TLS, disabling a defense) is an explicit, named decision in the builder, never the
   accidental result of an unset flag.

---

## Phase 0 — Foundational refactors (unblock everything else) — target `0.4`

These are not features, but every default-on capability below is blocked on them. They turn the
one-shot `serve()` into a real, observable, controllable service.

- **Kill the global `ONION_NAME` singleton** (`static LazyLock<Mutex<String>>`). It hard-limits the
  crate to **one onion service per process** and forces the awkward poll-the-global readiness loop
  in the README. Replace with a per-service **handle** returned from the builder. This is the
  precondition for multi-service hosting and a shared client (Phase 4).
- **Fix the per-request thread+runtime hack.** `handle_tls_connection` spawns a fresh OS thread
  *and* a new current-thread tokio runtime for every single hyper request, then `.join()`s it.
  That is a correctness and throughput landmine — it should run on the existing runtime via a
  `tower`/`hyper` service directly. It must be fixed before any traffic- or defense-sensitive
  feature (PoW, high traffic) can be trusted.
- **First-class readiness + graceful shutdown.** Return a handle instead of `bail!`-ing forever:

  ```rust
  let handle = OnionService::builder()
      .router(app)
      .nickname("my_onion")
      .serve()
      .await?;                          // full secure stack, no extra config

  handle.ready().await;                 // descriptor published, reachable
  println!("{}", handle.onion_address());
  // ... later
  handle.shutdown().await;              // CancellationToken under the hood
  ```

  `serve(app, nickname)` becomes a three-line wrapper over this builder.

---

## Phase 1 — Stable identity by default — target `0.5`

The `.onion` address *is* the service's public key. A frontier framework should make the address
**stable out of the box**, not leave persistence to chance. (As of 0.3.1 the client already uses a
dedicated `./tor/onyums/state` keystore; this phase makes identity a first-class, intentional part
of the API rather than an implementation detail.)

- **Persistent keystore is the default** → stable address across restarts with zero configuration.
  `.ephemeral()` is the explicit opt-*down* for throwaway services; persistence is never something
  you have to remember to turn on.
- **Bring-your-own identity key** — import an existing v3 HS secret key to migrate a service onto
  onyums without changing its address.
- **Vanity address mining** — generate keys until the address matches a desired prefix,
  parallelized across cores. Built in; nothing in arti does this for you.
- **Address helpers** — typed `OnionAddress`, QR / `Onion-Location` header emission, and clear docs
  that the keystore path is relative to the working directory.

---

## Phase 2 — Abuse resistance, live by default — target `0.6`

Onion services have abuse-resistance primitives no clearnet server has. The frontier stance is that
onyums **ships these active**, not as exotic add-ons an operator has to discover.

- **Proof-of-Work DoS defense** — client puzzles that throttle introduction floods, with effort
  tuning, backed by arti's (experimental) `tor-hspow`. Shipped on by default; the headline anti-DoS
  feature for onion services. Operators tune effort or opt down, they don't opt in.
- **v3 Client Authorization / Restricted Discovery** — only clients holding an authorized key can
  even *discover* (let alone connect to) the service. A one-call builder API
  (`.authorized_clients([...])`) turns an onion service into a cryptographically private endpoint.
  Supported by arti's `tor-hsservice`.
- **Circuit policy & rate caps** — surface intro-point counts, per-circuit connection caps, and a
  policy hook to reject circuits. We already `shutdown_circuit()` in `handle_stream_request` for
  non-80/443 ports — generalize that one-off into a first-class policy callback.

> **Onyums Skin** — the broader "Cloudflare for Tor" abuse-defense layer (challenge/PoW gate,
> stateless clearance tokens, token/circuit-keyed rate limiting, no-JS fallbacks, and a pure-Rust
> WAF) is the major expansion of this phase. It lands as a standalone `onyums-skin` crate. Full
> design, component decisions, and API sketch: [crates/onyums-skin/ROADMAP.md](crates/onyums-skin/ROADMAP.md).

**Skin integration (the onyums side).** What onyums itself must do to consume `onyums-skin` — these
land as Skin's phases ship, and are the onyums-roadmap counterpart to that crate's roadmap:

- **Insert `SkinLayer` into the served `Router`** so the challenge/PoW gate, clearance-token check,
  token-keyed rate limiting, and (later) the WAF run ahead of the application on the HTTP path.
- **Implement `onyums_skin::CircuitPolicy` and drive it from the rendezvous loop** —
  `handle_stream_request` maps `CircuitAction::{Accept, Challenge, Reject, Shutdown}` onto accept /
  the challenge gate / reject / `shutdown_circuit()`, giving Skin the per-circuit dimension a plain
  HTTP app can't express. This is the concrete form of the "circuit policy & rate caps" bullet above.
- **Expose it through the builder** — `.skin(SkinConfig)` (secure default **on**; `.no_skin()` to
  opt down), plus an **Under Attack Mode** toggle that forces every new circuit through the gate.
- **Feed Skin's adaptive-difficulty signal** from onyums-observed circuit/request rate, since the
  intro-layer PoW effort is not surfaced by Arti.
- **Compose with the Tor-native layers in this phase** — restricted discovery (a descriptor-crypto
  allowlist) and service-side PoW sit *beneath* Skin's app-layer gate; surface Skin's security
  events (challenge/WAF/rate-limit/teardown) into the Phase 4 observability stream.

---

## Phase 3 — TLS-first transport & protocol versatility — target `0.7`

Today `handle_stream_request` hardcodes port 443 → TLS+axum, port 80 → redirect, everything else →
reject. This phase keeps TLS as the enforced standard for HTTP while opening the service up to
arbitrary protocols.

- **TLS-first, with optional strict enforcement.** onyums already auto-upgrades plaintext HTTP
  (port 80) to HTTPS; this roadmap *doubles down* on TLS as the standard rather than treating it
  as redundant. Even though Tor encrypts and authenticates the channel via the `.onion` key,
  end-to-end TLS adds independent, defense-in-depth cryptographic authentication and — crucially —
  unlocks the browser **secure-context** semantics real apps depend on: WebCrypto, service
  workers, `Secure` / `__Host-` cookies, HTTP/2, and no mixed-content downgrades. The versatility
  is in *how* TLS is provisioned and enforced, never in turning it off for HTTP services:
  - **Default** — auto-generated self-signed cert (today's behavior) with HTTP→HTTPS upgrade on.
  - **Strict mode** (`.tls(Tls::Strict)`) — *reject* plaintext circuits outright instead of
    redirecting (no port-80 handler at all), and emit HSTS. For operators who want TLS to be
    non-negotiable.
  - **Bring-your-own cert** (`.tls(Tls::Provided(cert))`) — for CA-signed `.onion` certificates
    (e.g. HARICA), which some clients and browsers prefer over self-signed.
  Raw-TCP / non-HTTP handlers (below) negotiate their own transport security; the TLS-first stance
  is specifically about the built-in HTTP/WS handler.
- **Arbitrary port → handler mapping.** `.route_port(443, HttpHandler::new(app))`,
  `.route_port(9735, RawTcpHandler::new(...))`. A `StreamHandler` trait lets onyums tunnel *any*
  protocol over an onion service (gRPC, SSH, a game server, Lightning), not just HTTP/WS. The
  TLS-enforced HTTP handler remains the default built-in; raw handlers are the versatility layer.
- **Single onion service mode** — trade server-side anonymity for lower latency where the server
  is not trying to hide (common for high-traffic public onion sites). An explicit opt-down from the
  anonymous default.

---

## Phase 4 — Observability & multi-service — target `0.8`

- **Bootstrap & descriptor-upload progress** as a stream/callback, not just `tracing` logs — so
  `ready()` means "actually published and reachable," and apps can show real status.
- **Per-service metrics on the handle** — active circuits, connection counts, intro-point health,
  PoW effort in play, descriptor republish times.
- **Multiple services on one shared `TorClient`.** Once the singleton is gone, bootstrap *once* and
  launch N onion services on the same client — far cheaper than today's client-per-`serve()`.
  Enables multi-tenant hosting from one process.
- **Circuit-isolation controls** exposed through an enriched `ConnectionInfo` (beyond today's
  `circuit_id` + always-`None` `socket_addr`).

---

## Phase 5 — The framework layer: batteries-included MVC over axum — target `0.9+`

axum/hyper/tower give onyums a fast, correct HTTP core but a *microframework* surface — routing and
extractors, nothing above. Rails, Laravel, and Phoenix win on everything above that line:
scaffolding, an ORM with migrations, server-rendered views, forms + validation, auth, sessions,
background jobs. This phase brings a curated set of those batteries to onyums as high-level
abstractions over the existing stack — and two facts make the server-rendered-MVC tradition fit an
onion service *better* than it fits the clearnet:

1. **No-JS-first is the native idiom here.** Tor "Safer"/"Safest" disable JS and WASM, so the
   Rails/Phoenix server-rendered-HTML-with-progressive-enhancement model isn't a throwback — it is
   the *correct* default for an onion site. It also dovetails with onyums-skin's no-JS gate.
2. **Self-contained / no-daemon is the native deployment.** Onion services run on a single box and
   avoid external services (Redis, S3, SMTP) for anonymity and operational simplicity. Rails 8's
   "Solid" direction — DB-backed queue/cache/cable, SQLite in production, no Redis — maps onto that
   exactly. **The organizing rule for this phase: every battery must run with no external daemon.**

Consistent with onyums' frontier posture, these ship wired-up and convention-first, not as a bag of
optional parts. Where a mature pure-Rust crate exists we **reuse**; the value onyums adds is the
*conventions and glue* that make them feel like one framework.

### A. Server-rendered MVC core (no-JS-first)
- **Views — single-file components, async server-rendered.** The default view layer is the SFC,
  adapted to Rust as **four blocks: `<template>`, `<rust>`, `<style scoped>`, and `<script>`**. Both
  logic blocks follow Vue's **`<script setup>`** model (top-level setup code, bindings auto-exposed
  to the template) — there is no Options-API / legacy `<script>` mode to implement:
  - **`<rust>` is `<script setup>`, in Rust** — its API is a faithful analog of Vue's
    [Composition API](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/lifecycle): `ref` / `reactive` / `computed`
    / `watch` / `watch_effect` plus the lifecycle hooks (`on_server_prefetch`, `on_mounted`,
    `on_updated`, `on_before_unmount`, `on_unmounted`, …) as async Rust with the same names and
    semantics, so a Vue developer's mental model transfers directly.
  - **`<script>` is `<script setup>`, in JavaScript** — real Vue.js with the full Composition API and
    runtime.

  **The lifecycle hook — not the block — decides where code runs.** This is the crux, and it mirrors
  how Vue SSR already works: `setup` and `on_server_prefetch` run on the **server** during SSR, while
  the mount/update/unmount hooks run on the **client** after hydration. onyums applies that same
  split to *both* logic blocks, so code crosses the server/client line by *hook*, never by tag:
  - **Server-phase** (`setup`, `on_server_prefetch`) → runs on the server. `<rust>` here is native
    async Rust (it can `.await` a Turso query, a Tor-client call, or an onyums-skin check directly);
    `<script>` here is Vue JS executed on the server via an embedded JS engine.
  - **Client-phase** (`on_mounted`, `on_updated`, `on_unmounted`, …) → runs on the client. `<script>`
    here is Vue JS in the browser; `<rust>` here is compiled to **WASM**.
  - **Server actions** (`#[server]`-style fns / form handlers) → compiled to an **axum endpoint**,
    reached by a plain `<form>` POST (no JS) or `fetch` (JS).

  So *some JavaScript executes on the server, and some Rust executes on the client (WASM)* —
  determined entirely by the hook the code lives in. **No-JS-first discipline holds:** the server
  output (server-phase hooks + `<template>`) is fully functional on its own; client-phase code (WASM
  or Vue JS) only *enhances* and is inert under Tor "Safest". The hook that picks the run target is
  the same line that protects the no-JS baseline.

  **Async-everywhere, tokio-multithreaded** — the real departure from Leptos/Dioxus, whose reactive
  cores are *synchronous* (component fns are `fn`; async bolted on via `Resource`/`Suspense`) and
  often `!Send` / single-thread. In onyums the **server side — setup, lifecycle, server actions, and
  the reactive runtime itself — is async-native and `Send + Sync` on the same tokio multithreaded
  runtime as axum and arti**, so server-phase work composes across work-stealing threads with no
  `Resource`/`Suspense` ceremony.

  **The deep builds** (named honestly): a `Send + Sync` async reactive runtime that mirrors the
  Composition API (materially harder than a thread-local sync one — why Leptos chose `!Send`
  signals); a Rust→WASM compile path for client-phase `<rust>`; and a server-side JS engine to run
  server-phase `<script>` (the pure-Rust `boa` is the on-brand option, though immature — otherwise a
  heavier embedded engine). These are the headline bet of the phase.

  Other Vue/Nuxt cues in the same spirit: file-based routing (a `pages/` directory → axum routes) and
  layouts/slots. The `<template>` can still lower onto a Rust engine (`askama`/`maud`) or a
  purpose-built compiler under the hood, but the surface is the SFC.

  ```
  <template>      <!-- HTML, directives, slots; the shared server/client contract -->
  <rust>          // <script setup> in Rust (Composition-API analog), async + Send+Sync
  <style scoped>
  <script>        // <script setup> in real Vue.js
  ```
  Where each line of `<rust>` / `<script>` runs — server, client/WASM, or an axum endpoint — is set
  by its lifecycle hook, not by which block it is in. *Build — the clearest "abstraction over axum"
  of the framework layer.*
- **Typed forms + validation** — `axum::Form` extraction + `garde` / `validator`, with
  server-rendered error re-rendering (Laravel Form Requests / Phoenix changesets). The no-JS form is
  the primary UI, not a fallback. *Reuse + glue.*
- **Flash messages + CSRF** — signed/encrypted-cookie flash and per-form CSRF tokens, on by default
  for state-changing requests (Rails/Laravel parity). `axum-extra` cookies + a CSRF layer.
  *Reuse + small build.*

### B. Self-contained data & jobs (no daemon)
- **Database — Turso by default.** The default datastore is **Turso** (SQLite-compatible): the
  embedded **libSQL** today — single-file, no daemon, with optional embedded replicas / sync for
  backup without standing up a database server — converging on the **pure-Rust Turso Database**
  (formerly Limbo) as it matures, which also lands the no-FFI goal. This keeps the self-contained /
  single-box thesis and matches the wider toolchain (sibling projects already run on Turso/libSQL). A
  query + migration layer (`sqlx` compile-time-checked queries, or `sea-orm` for a richer entity
  API) plus seeds sits on top. *Reuse (libSQL today) → track the pure-Rust engine.*
- **Background jobs / queue** — `apalis` on its **SQLite backend** (no Redis): the Solid-Queue
  analog — enqueue, retry, schedule, all in the app DB. *Reuse.*
- **Cache** — `moka` in-process (Solid-Cache analog for a single box); a DB-backed tier optional.
  *Reuse.*
- **Sessions** — `tower-sessions` with a SQLite store and signed/encrypted cookies, composing with
  onyums-skin clearance tokens into one identity story. *Reuse.*
- **Outbound mailer (Tor-native, opt-in)** — transactional email (password resets, notifications) à
  la ActionMailer, but **relayed through onyums' own embedded arti `TorClient`** to an external SMTP
  server, so mail leaves over a Tor circuit and never reveals the service's location. Built on
  `lettre` and enqueued through the background-jobs queue above. Opt-in, because it needs an SMTP
  relay configured (like every framework's mailer) — so it is not part of the zero-config default,
  but it is supported, not excluded. *Reuse (`lettre`) + glue.*

### C. Auth & secrets
- **Built-in auth scaffold** — password auth (`argon2` via `password-auth`) + session login
  (`axum-login`), generated and wired à la Rails 8 `generate authentication` / `mix phx.gen.auth`.
  **Tor-aware:** it layers on onyums-skin's gate and Tor restricted discovery rather than
  reinventing access control. *Reuse + scaffold.*
- **Encrypted credentials / typed config** — a Rails-credentials-style encrypted store for what an
  onion box must hold (HS identity keys, the clearance-signing secret, app secrets), plus typed
  config with dev/prod profiles (`figment`). *Build (thin).*

### D. Scaffolding & conventions (the Rails `new` / `generate` story)
- **`onyums new` / `onyums generate`** — a companion CLI (`cargo-generate` template + a binary) that
  scaffolds a convention-over-configuration onion-service app: directory layout, a wired Router,
  migrations and views dirs, the secure defaults already on. The single biggest DX lever these
  frameworks pull. *Build (on `cargo-generate` + `clap`).*
- **Dev error pages + health check** — friendly dev exception pages and a `/up` liveness endpoint
  (Rails 8). *Build (small).*
- **Test harness without live Tor** — request-level tests via `tower::ServiceExt::oneshot` plus
  factory/fixture conventions; this is also the "testable without Tor" need noted in Cross-cutting.
  *Reuse + conventions.*

### Explicit non-goals (the un-Rails parts)
- **No inbound mail server.** onyums won't run an MTA or receive email — that needs a listening
  daemon and is squarely out of scope. *Outbound* transactional mail *is* supported, Tor-native and
  opt-in (see section B) — only receiving is excluded.
- **No heavy asset pipeline.** Ship fingerprinted static-asset serving, not a Propshaft/Vite bundler;
  onion sites are lean and no-JS-leaning.
- **No LiveView/Hotwire reactive layer.** Server-driven reactive UIs require client JS, contradicting
  the no-JS-first thesis. Keep WS-over-Tor + SSE + simple pub/sub; don't build a JS-dependent
  reactive framework.
- **No ActiveRecord "magic."** Rust favors explicitness — migrations + a typed query convention
  (`sqlx`/`sea-orm`), not a metaprogrammed model layer.

This layer likely grows into companion crates (an `onyums-web` / `onyums-cli` family) rather than
bloating the core server crate, mirroring the `onyums` / `onyums-skin` split.

---

## Cross-cutting: developer experience

- **Re-export the arti stack we depend on** (as we do `axum`) so downstreams can't get
  version-skewed.
- **Document the secure defaults loudly.** Because onyums is secure-and-complete by default, the
  docs must make the *opt-downs* (ephemeral identity, non-strict TLS, disabled PoW, single-onion
  mode) explicit and visible — a user should always know what they are turning off.
- **A test harness that doesn't need the live Tor network.** Integration tests currently require
  real bootstrapping (`test_serve` hits the real network and swallows errors). An
  in-process/loopback mode would make onyums testable in CI.

---

## Suggested layered API (full-by-default, override-when-needed)

```
Tier 0  serve(app, "nick")                 the complete secure stack in one line:
                                           persistent identity, enforced/upgraded TLS, abuse defenses on
Tier 1  OnionService::builder()...serve()  tune or relax the defaults (TLS strictness, PoW effort,
                                           authorized clients, BYO cert/key, ephemeral identity)
Tier 2  handle.ready()/.onion_address()/.shutdown()/.metrics()
Tier 3  .with_tor_client(existing)         raw arti escape hatches
        .with_onion_config(OnionServiceConfig)
        .route_port(port, impl StreamHandler)
        raw access to RunningOnionService
```

You descend a tier only to *change* a default, never to *enable* a basic capability.

## Risks to track

- **arti API churn** — PoW and restricted discovery are newer/experimental in arti. Shipping them
  on-by-default means onyums tracks arti's frontier directly; pin versions and budget for breaking
  bumps (we just lived through a 0.39 → 0.43 one).
- **Secure defaults can surprise.** Persistent identity writes keys to disk (working-directory
  relative); strict TLS rejects plaintext; PoW costs clients CPU. Each default is correct, but each
  must be documented as a behavior, not a silent assumption.
- **Keystore format stability** across arti versions (matters for the "stable address" promise).
- **Keep it stable-Rust** — we removed the last nightly gate in 0.3.0; don't let a new dep drag it
  back.

---

Sequencing rationale: Phase 0 is pure enablement; Phases 1–2 deliver the highest-leverage,
default-on, *Tor-specific* differentiators (stable identity + live abuse resistance — things no
clearnet framework offers); Phase 3 enforces TLS while broadening protocol reach; Phase 4 rounds
out observability and scale; Phase 5 is the longer-horizon batteries-included framework layer that
turns the secure transport into a full app platform — server-rendered, no-JS-first, and
self-contained, the way an onion service actually wants to be built.
